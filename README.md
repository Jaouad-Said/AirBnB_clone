# Project Name: AirBnB Clone

## Project Description:

This project involves deploying a simplified replica of the AirBnB website on our server. The objective is to create a functional copy of the AirBnB platform, allowing users to manage accommodations, bookings, and other relevant functionalities.

### Command Line Interpreter Description:

The Command Line Interpreter (CLI) for this project functions similarly to a shell but is specifically tailored to the needs of our AirBnB Clone. The CLI enables users to perform various operations on objects within the project scope:

### Create a New Object:

Users can generate new instances of objects such as a new user or a new place, contributing to the overall content of the AirBnB Clone.

### Retrieve an Object:

Objects can be fetched from various sources, including files or databases, allowing users to access and work with existing data.

### Perform Operations on Objects:

Users can execute operations on objects, such as counting, computing statistics, and other relevant tasks to enhance the functionality of the AirBnB Clone.

### Update Object Attributes:

The CLI facilitates the modification of object attributes, ensuring that users can keep information up-to-date and accurate.

### Destroy an Object:

In cases where an object is no longer needed, users can use the CLI to delete or destroy it, managing the project's content effectively.

This command line interface serves as a powerful tool for users to interact with the AirBnB Clone project, providing a streamlined and efficient way to manage and manipulate data within the system.
